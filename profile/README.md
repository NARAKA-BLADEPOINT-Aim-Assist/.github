# 🎯 NARAKA: BLADEPOINT Aim Assist Tool – Smart Targeting for Every Duel

Perfect timing wins fights — and the **NARAKA: BLADEPOINT Aim Assist Tool** ensures you never miss a strike.
Developed for serious players, it brings **machine-calibrated precision**, **predictive movement tracking**, and **realistic aim correction** to both melee and ranged encounters.

Unlike conventional systems, this assist tool doesn’t just “snap” to enemies — it **learns your movement rhythm**, compensates for weapon recoil, and subtly guides your crosshair to maximize hit probability without breaking immersion.

## ⚙️ Overview

The **NARAKA Aim Assist** system combines real-time tracking with fine-tuned prediction models for every weapon type.
Whether you’re using a **Katana**, **Longsword**, or **Bow**, the algorithm adapts to the unique hit timing and distance curve of each weapon, improving consistency without breaking natural gameplay feel.

[!NOTE]

> The tool runs externally — no direct memory modification. It overlays predictive movement and angle correction via secure kernel driver for stability and safety.

### Key Benefits

* Precision-lock tracking with parry assist timing
* Smart FOV calibration (auto-adjusts during grappling or dodging)
* Smooth targeting curves for both melee and ranged attacks
* Dynamic recoil compensation for projectile weapons
* Fully controller compatible (Xbox & DualShock)
* Stream-safe rendering and overlay protection
